        <h1>Authenticity</h1>
        <p>
          I strive to be as authentic as possible with myself and with others.
          Dishonesty makes me uncomfortable, even when it is for the sake of
          protecting someone’s feelings. While I try my best to communicate with
          compassion, I believe that it is necessary to be clear and direct in
          order to demonstrate respect. At the end of the day, I would much
          rather be disliked for who I am than to be liked for pretending to be
          someone who I am not.

        <h1>Connection</h1>
        <p>
          My most treasured memories all involve developing bonds with others
          through shared experiences. I find immense joy in getting to know
          people deeply - understanding what motivates them, what scares them,
          what fulfills them. When it comes to social relationships, I value
          quality over quantity. I am intentionally selective about who I spend
          time with, but I am extremely loyal to those in my inner circle and
          fully invested in their well-being.

        <h1>Autonomy</h1>
        <p>
          I have high self-efficacy when I am at my best. I aim to have full
          control of my decisions and take full responsibility for their
          outcomes. In general, I think it is important to protect everyone’s
          right to individual liberty. Personally, I want to live my life in
          peace without being coerced by someone else’s agenda. In turn, I
          refrain from imposing my own morals onto others. I believe that people
          who have different moral systems can coexist and find common ground
          when they practice mutual respect.

        <h1>Discipline</h1>
        <p>
          Growth is achieved by developing discipline to lean into hard things
          consistently. By showing up for myself, hard things eventually become
          easier, and effortful things eventually become automatic habits. I
          believe that people are antifragile and the only way to be prepared
          for the chaos of life is to continually find new ways to challenge the
          mind and body. I add tasks to my routine that make me uncomfortable,
          but from which I am able to adapt and recover.
